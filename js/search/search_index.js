Basic setup should something like this:\n{\n  \"page\": {\n    // Basic presets class is provided by the Label Designer and you can use that to include\n    // different page sizes and known border styles \n    \"height.mm\": 297,\n    \"width.mm\": 210,\n    \"paddingTop.mm\": 10,\n    \"paddingLeft.mm\": 10,\n    \"paddingBottom.mm\": 10,\n    \"paddingRight.mm\": 10\n  },\n  \"label\": {\n    \"height.mm\": 20,\n    \"width.mm\": 50,\n    \"marginTop.mm\": 1.5,\n    \"marginLeft.mm\": 1.5,\n    \"marginBottom.mm\": 1.5,\n    \"marginRight.mm\": 1.5,\n    \"font-family\": \"Arial\",\n    \"font-size.pt\": 9\n  },\n  \"labelItems\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"field\",\n      \"style\": {\n        \"width.mm\": 13,\n        \"height.mm\": 13,\n      },\n      \"x\": 0, // x position im mm\n      \"y\": 0, // y position im mm\n      \"fields\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"uri\",                     // value for this is picked from the data with this key.\n          \"content\": \"http://example.com/ID\", // This is displayed in the preview (with qr-code type QR Code is displayed instead)\n          \"label\": \"URI - QRCode\",            // This label that is visible on the editor.\n          \"type\": FieldType.qrCode            // This is optional and editor will enable special features based on this.\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"field\",\n      \"style\": {\n        \"width.mm\": 35,\n        \"height.mm\": 5,\n      },\n      \"x\": 15,\n      \"y\": 0,\n      \"fields\": [\n        {\"field\": \"uri\", \"content\": \"http://example.com/ID\", \"label\": \"URI\", \"type\":  FieldType.uri},\n        {\"field\": \"species\", \"content\": \"Parus major\", \"label\": \"Species\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}If you're using json schema spec you can use provided\nSchemaService to \nextract available fields data for you. Please note that all the features of json schema are not supported.\nBasic availableFields looks something like this:\n[\n  {\n    \"field\": \"uri\",                     // Values is picked from this key on the data\n    \"content\": \"http://example.com/ID\", \n    \"label\": \"URI - QRCode\",           \n    \"type\": \"qr-code\"                   // Tells the Label Designer to convert this field value to QR Code\n  },\n  {\n    \"field\": \"uri\",\n    \"content\": \"http://example.com/ID\", // This value is shown on the preview\n    \"label\": \"URI\",                     // This value is shown on the editor \n    \"type\": \"uri\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"field\": \"\",                        // This fields value is not picked from the data\n    \"content\": \"Text\",\n    \"label\": \"Text\",\n    \"type\": \"text\"                      // text type means that the value can be inputted from editor and it's not picked from the data.\n  },\n  {\n    \"field\": \"gatheringEvent.dateBegin\",\n    \"label\": \"Start date\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"field\": \"gatheringEvent.dateEnd\",\n    \"label\": \"End date\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"field\": \"keywords\",\n    \"isArray\": true,                    // If the data contains an array this needs to be set to true.

If you’ve found a\nbug, create an associated issue. Including an issue reproduction\n(via CodePen, JsBin, Plunkr, etc.) is the absolute best way to help the team quickly\ndiagnose the problem. Screenshots are also helpful.\nPull request process\n\nWe recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).\nNew code should follow the style used in the project.\nWe use compodoc for documentation.\nFor user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of docs/CHANGELOG.md below the\ncurrent development version header describing the changes made followed by your\nusername, and links to relevant issue(s)/PR(s).\n\nCode of Conduct\nPlease note that this project is released with a\nContributor Code of Conduct.
